# T.H.O.M.A.S. CORE

Repository for the core module of the T.H.O.M.A.S. Project

## About T.H.O.M.A.S.
The acronym stands for "*Tool for Handling Operations, Management, and Assistance Strategies*".

And it's also my son's name.

The aim of this project is to be a P.O.C. (Proof of Concept), a clean architecture study, where any framework can be used for information I/O, and it is not necessary to rewrite any business rules, just the plugins of the frameworks that were used.

This module holds the core functionalities for all other projects, such as session context, roles, security entities, common extensions, some base classes and other things.

This project is for personal use.
